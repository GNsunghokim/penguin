## The reason of dual-license and the role of GurumNetworks
PacketNgin is very carefully designed to use dual-licensing strategy. Most of the users are not necessary to use proprietary license(GPL license is very attractive to most of users). But some company need to make their own network device with their intellectual property need alternative license rather than GPL.

The role of GurumNetworks, Inc. is make a virtuous cycle to develop the product intensively and continuously. We promise most of income from commercial licensing will be reinvested to develop OSS version of the product.
